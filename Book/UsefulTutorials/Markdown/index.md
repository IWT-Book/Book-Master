#This is useful tutorial, if you do not know markdown. 

[Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

> "Markdown is a way to write content for the web. It’s written in what nerds like
to call “plaintext”, which is exactly the sort of text you’re used to writing
and seeing. Plaintext is just the regular alphabet, with a few familiar
symbols, like asterisks ( * ) and backticks ( ` )." (By markdown) 

Lets do it. It should not take more then **30 min**

1. **_Italic_**

    surround the word/s with _

    **_Example_**: (_)Hello World(_) _Hellow World_

2. **_Bold_**

    surround the word/s with **

    **_Example_**:(**)Hello World(**) **Hello World**

    **_Note_**: you can use both in the same line

3. **_Headers_** 

    put infront of the sentance #, and the number of #s are the size. (#) is header one and (###) is header three. We have six different headers. The bigest is (#) and the smallest is (######).

    **_Example_**: header four would have four #### infront of it.    

    **_Note_**: You cant make header bold but you can make it italic.

4. **_Links_**

    You can do links in two ways. Both ways are render the same way. The first link style is called an inline link. We wrap the link text in brackets ( [] ), and then wrap the actual link in parenthesis ( () ).

    **_Example_**: Use Google. www.Google.com. We put use Google in brackets and the www.Google.com in parenthesis. [Use Google.](www.Google.com)

    **_Note_**: it is posible to use bold, italic, and headers with links.

    **_Note 2_**: Not very positive about the second way of doing links.

5. **_Images_**

    Images are smiler to links, and it also has two ways of doing it. Inline images start with    
    ( ! ) [discrption] (link).

    **_Note_**: Not very positive about the second way of doing images.

6. **_Block Quotes_**

    If you use some other resource, you can use blockquoutes to give that person the credit. To use blcokqute, all what you have to do is placing the ( > ) in the front of that block. If the quote go over multipull lines, use ( > ) in every line. Even in the blank lines. 

    **_Note_**: the block quotes can contain italics, images, and/or links.

7. **_Lists_**

    There are two types of list. One with bullet points, and two with numbers. To create a list with bullet points, preface each element with ( * ).

    **_Note_**: After ( * ), you should put one white space. 

    **_Sublist_**

    Sublists are the same. You just need to indent each astrisk with one space.

    **_Note_**: You can use other markdown tags with the list. Italic and bold etc. 

    The other type of list (the one with number). We preface each element with ( 1. ). We bassiclly put a number then dot and then white space. 

    **_Note_**: After ( number. ), you should put one white space.

    **_Note_**: To create number list with paragraphs, the paragraphs should start in new line and indent with at least one white space. 

8. **_Paragraphs_**

    Break each sentance with new line. (Hard break).
