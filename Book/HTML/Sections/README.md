Before the rise of HTML 5, the HTML markup language was defined as an application of
 [SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Generalized_Markup_Language). 
 SGML is a _metalanguage_ used to to define markup languages. HTML (versions 2-4) is the most 
well-known example of an SGML defined language.

To define an SGML based markup language you write a grammar for your language in the form of a _document type definition_ or DTD.
A document type definition defines the various rules for the components of the markup language, namely the tags and their attributes.




Moderns only read a <!DOCTYPE> statement to determine what rendering mode to enter, either a standards compliance mode or a more permissive mode called quirks mode.  This process is generally dubbed _doctype switching_.
