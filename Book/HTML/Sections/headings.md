# Headings

The HTML elements &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; define headings from a level 1 (most important) to 6 least important.  Headings visually run from large (&lt;h1&gt;) to small (&lt;h6&gt;). However, since headings are semantic elements you should not assume this and apply style primarily via CSS. I __just__ added some content!

<section data-markdown data-render="slide">
<script type="text/template"> 
   #Headings
   
   * 6 levels of headings &lt;h1&gt; - &lt;h6&gt;
   * Semantic Block Elements
   * Generally render from large to small
   
</script>
</section>

<section>
  {% codeeditor src='../../../HTML/4Elements/sections/hn.html' %}{% endcodeeditor %}
</section>

<section data-render="book">
  Just in the book!
</section>
