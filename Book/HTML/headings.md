# Headings

The HTML elements &lt;h1&gt; to <h6> define headings from a level 1 (most important) to 6 least important.  Headings visually run from large (&lt;h&gt;>) to small (<h6>). However, since headings are semantic elements you should not assume this and apply style primarily via CSS.

<section data-markdown data-render="slide">
<script type="text/template">
