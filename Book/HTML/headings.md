# Headings

The HTML elements <h1> to <h6> define headings from a level 1 (most important) to 6 least important.  Headings visually run from large (<h1>) to small (<h6>). However, since headings are semantic elements you should not assume this and apply style primarily via CSS.

<section data-markdown data-render="slide">
<script type="text/template">
