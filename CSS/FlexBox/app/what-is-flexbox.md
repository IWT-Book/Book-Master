# What is Flexbox?

*Flexbox* is a native alternative for handling CSS layout.

From the W3 specification: 
<blockquote>'... the children of a flex container can be laid out in any direction, and can "flex" their sizes, either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent.' <sup><a href="references.md">[1]</a></sup></blockquote>

In short, it allows you to quickly layout child elements uniformly, where they all respond to each other automatically.
