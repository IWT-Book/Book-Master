    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines the picture element as following, 
       "The picture element is a container which provides multiples 
       sources to its contained img element to allow authors to declaratively
       control or give hints to the user agent about which image resource to use, 
       based on the screen pixel density, viewport size, image format, and other factors.
       It represents its children."</p>
