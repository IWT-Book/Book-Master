    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines figure as following,
       "The figure element represents some flow content, 
       optionally with a caption, that is self-contained 
       (like a complete sentence) and is typically referenced
       as a single unit from the main flow of the document."

<p>Yes it is another boring example. In this case we would like you
    to review <a href="#fig1">Figure Ex-1</a></p>
<p>More and more text is found until eventually the figure is
    located.</p>
<figure id="fig1">
    <img src="../../images/html5.png"  alt="HTML 5" width="300" height="200">
    <figcaption>Figure 1. HTML5</figcaption>
    <p>The mighty fig tag has returned from HTML 3 as figure to haunt your dreams.</p>
</figure>
<p>Maybe some more content here.</p>
