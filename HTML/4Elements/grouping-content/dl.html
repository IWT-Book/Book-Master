    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines dl as following, 
        "The dl element represents a description list of zero or more term-description groups. 
        Each term-description group consists of one or more terms (represented by dt elements) 
        possibly as children of a div element child, and one or more descriptions 
        (represented by dd elements possibly as children of a div element child), 
        ignoring any nodes other than dt and dd element children, and dt and dd elements
         that are children of div element children within a single dl element."
