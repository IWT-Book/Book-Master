    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines figcaption as following, 
        "The figcaption element represents a caption 
        or legend for the rest of the contents of the 
        &lt;figcaption> elementâ€™s parent &lt;figure> element, if any."
    </p>

<p>Yes it is another boring example. In this case we would like you
    to review <a href="#fig1">Figure Ex-1</a></p>
<p>More and more text is found until eventually the figure is
    located.</p>
<figure id="fig1">
    <img src="../../images/html5.png"  alt="HTML 5" width="300" height="200">
    <figcaption>Figure 1. HTML5</figcaption>
    <p>The mighty fig tag has returned from HTML 3 as figure to haunt
        your dreams.</p>
    
</figure>
<p>Maybe some more content here.</p>
