    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines blockquote as following, 
        "The blockquote element represents content that 
        is quoted from another source, optionally with a 
        citation which must be within a footer or cite element, 
        and optionally with in-line changes such as annotations and abbreviations."

A passage from the Declaration of Independence:
<blockquote cite="http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/DeclarInd.html">
    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,
    that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
