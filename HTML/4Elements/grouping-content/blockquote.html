A passage from the Declaration of Independence:
<blockquote cite="http://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/ourdocs/DeclarInd.html">
    We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights,
    that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
