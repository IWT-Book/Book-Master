    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines footer element as following, 
        "The footer element represents a footer for its 
        nearest ancestor main element or sectioning content 
        or sectioning root element. A footer typically contains
        information about its section, such as who wrote it, 
        links to related documents, copyright data, and the like."
