    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines aside element as following, 
        "The aside element represents a section of a page 
        that consists of content that is tangentially related 
        to the content of the parenting sectioning content, and 
        which could be considered separate from that content. 
        Such sections are often represented as sidebars in printed typography."

<p>Ok now back to the point I was attempting to make before my untimely aside.</p>
