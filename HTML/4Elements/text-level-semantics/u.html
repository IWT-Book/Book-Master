    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines u element as following,
        "The u element represents a span of text with an unarticulated, 
        though explicitly rendered, non-textual annotation, such as 
        labeling the text as being a proper name in Chinese text 
        (a Chinese proper name mark), or labeling the text as being misspelt."
    </p>
<p>Here is some <u>underlined text</u>.</p>
<p>Be careful with <u>underlined</u> text; it looks like
    <a href="http://www.pint.com/">a link</a>.</p>
<p>If you must <span style="text-decoration: underline;">underline use CSS</span> please.</p>
