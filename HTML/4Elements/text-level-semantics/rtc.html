    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines rtc element as following,
        "The rtc element marks a ruby text container for ruby text components in a ruby annotation. 
        When it is the child of a ruby element it doesn’t represent anything itself, 
        but its parent ruby element uses it as part of determining what it represents."
