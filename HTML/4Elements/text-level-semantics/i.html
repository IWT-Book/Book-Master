    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines i element as following, 
        "The i element represents a span of text in an 
        alternate voice or mood, or otherwise offset from 
        the normal prose in a manner indicating a different 
        quality of text, such as a taxonomic designation, a 
        technical term, an idiomatic phrase from another language,
         transliteration, a thought, or a ship name in Western texts."
