    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines var element as following, 
        "The var element represents a variable. 
        This could be an actual variable in a mathematical
        expression or programming context, an identifier 
        representing a constant, a symbol identifying a physical
        quantity, a function parameter, or just be a term used as
         a placeholder in prose."
    </p>
<p>In Math the variable <var>x</var> holds the answer to many
    of life's most important questions. It contains the time it takes
    two speeding trains to meet when they have left two different
    stations travelling at different speeds, the number of lemons you
    have left over after trading with people, and all sorts of other
    interesting values.</p>
