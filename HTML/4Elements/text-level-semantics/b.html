    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines b element as following, 
        "The b element represents a span of text to 
        which attention is being drawn for utilitarian 
        purposes without conveying any extra importance 
        and with no implication of an alternate voice or
        mood, such as key words in a document abstract, 
        product names in a review, actionable words in 
        interactive text-driven software, or an article lede."
