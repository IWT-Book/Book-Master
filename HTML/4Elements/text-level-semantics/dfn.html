    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines dfn element as following, 
        "The dfn element represents the defining instance of a term.
         The term-description group , p, li or section element that is the 
         nearest ancestor of the dfn element must also contain the 
         definition(s) for the term given by the dfn element."
    </p>
