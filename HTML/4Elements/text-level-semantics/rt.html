    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines rt as following,
        "The rt element marks the ruby text component of a ruby annotation. 
        When it is the child of a ruby element or of an rtc element that is 
        itself the child of a ruby element, it doesn’t represent anything itself, 
        but its ancestor ruby element uses it as part of determining what it represents."
