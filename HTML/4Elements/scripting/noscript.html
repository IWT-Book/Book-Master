    <p>HTML 5 Specs defines noscript element as following, 
        "The noscript element represents nothing if scripting is enabled,
            and represents its children if scripting is disabled. It is used
            to present different markup to user agents that support scripting
            and those that donâ€™t support scripting, by affecting how the document
            is parsed."
